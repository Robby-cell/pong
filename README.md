# pong
pong made with piston in rust!

- todo: add sound

Game runs how pong would be expected to play out;
- to keep it simple, we arent letting the ball go out of bounds in the y direction.
- whoevers side the ball exits on, opposing player gets a point

controls:
- pause -> space
- move player1 and player2 up and down -> w, s and i, k (respectively)
- quit game while in menu -> q
- unpause is also space
